    "document_summary": "The document 'File_008.xlsx' is an Excel spreadsheet containing employee data related to in-person verification for token issuance. It includes sensitive information such as employee full names, employee IDs, dates of verification, names and initials of verifying personnel (RA), supervisors authorizing token issuance, supervisor emails, token serial numbers, and token issuance dates. The purpose appears to be tracking and auditing the issuance of security tokens to employees. Its security relevance stems from the handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and information about security tokens, requiring appropriate controls to prevent unauthorized access or modification.",
    "key_security_findings": [
        "The document contains PII including employee full names, IDs, and supervisor email addresses, making it a target for data breaches and identity theft.",
        "The spreadsheet format lacks built-in access controls and encryption, leaving the data vulnerable if the file is accessed by unauthorized individuals.",
        "The inconsistent data entry format in fields like 'Verified By (RA Name)' (e.g., full names, initials, organization names) and the presence of titles (Mr., Mrs., DVM) suggests a lack of standardized data entry processes, potentially leading to inaccuracies and difficulty in auditing.",
        "The inclusion of 'RA Signature / Initials' indicates a reliance on manual verification processes, which may be susceptible to forgery or misrepresentation if proper validation procedures are not in place.",
        "The presence of hostname values (likely used as stand-ins in this context) instead of actual dates suggests incomplete or missing data in the 'Date of In-Person Verification', 'Date of Authorization', and 'Token Issuance Date' columns, which compromises the auditability and validity of the token issuance process. Actual hostnames showing up would expose internal infrastructure information."
